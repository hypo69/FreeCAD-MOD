Excellent! Let's move on to **Lesson 7** — where we'll prepare your addon for publication so that other users can access it through FreeCAD's **official Addon Manager**.

# 📘 Tutorial: Creating Addons for FreeCAD
## Lesson 7. Publishing an Addon: From Folder to GitHub and Addon Manager

> **Lesson Goal**: Prepare the addon for distribution, create metadata, and publish it on GitHub so that any FreeCAD user can install it with a single click.

---

## 📦 Part 1. What is the Addon Manager?

The **Addon Manager** is a built-in FreeCAD tool (`Tools → Addon Manager`) that:
- Displays a catalog of **300+ official addons**
- Allows you to **install, update, and remove** addons without manually copying files
- Works with **GitHub repositories**

For your addon to appear there, you need to:
1. Upload it to **GitHub**
2. Add a **`package.xml`** file
3. (Optional) Submit a PR to [FreeCAD-addons](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons)

---

## 🗂 Part 2. Preparing the Repository Structure

Your folder should look like this:

```
BoxBuilderAddon/                ← repository root
├── Resources/
│   └── icons/
│       ├── box_builder.svg
│       └── create_box.svg
├── InitGui.py
├── box_builder_workbench.py
├── package.xml                 ← REQUIRED!
├── README.md                   ← recommended
└── LICENSE                     ← required for publication
```

> 💡 **Important**: The root folder name **must match** the addon name and be the same as in `InitGui.py`.

---

## 📄 Part 3. Creating `package.xml`

This file describes your addon for the Addon Manager.

Create a `package.xml` file in the root:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?>
<package format="1" xmlns="https://wiki.freecad.org/Package_Metadata">
  <name>BoxBuilderAddon</name>
  <description>
    A simple tool to create parametric boxes with custom dimensions and GUI.
    Saves last used values between sessions.
  </description>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <date>2025-04-05</date>

  <maintainer email="your.email@example.com">Your Name</maintainer>

  <license file="LICENSE">LGPL-2.1-or-later</license>

  <url type="repository" branch="main">https://github.com/yourname/BoxBuilderAddon</url>
  <url type="bugtracker">https://github.com/yourname/BoxBuilderAddon/issues</url>

  <icon>Resources/icons/box_builder.svg</icon>

  <content>
    <workbench>BoxBuilderAddon</workbench>
  </content>

  <dependencies>
    <freecad>0.20</freecad>
  </dependencies>
</package>
```

### 🔍 Required fields:
- `<name>` — must match the folder name
- `<version>` — in `X.Y.Z` format
- `<license>` — specify the `LICENSE` file and license type
- `<url type="repository">` — link to your GitHub
- `<icon>` — path to the icon (relative to the root)
- `<content><workbench>...</workbench></content>` — indicates that this is a workbench

> 💡 A license is **mandatory**. **LGPL-2.1-or-later** is recommended (like FreeCAD itself).

---

## 📄 Part 4. The `LICENSE` file

Create a `LICENSE` file with the license text.

Example for **LGPL-2.1**:
1. Go to: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt
2. Copy the entire text
3. Paste it into the `LICENSE` file

Or use GitHub: you can choose a license automatically when creating a repository.

---

## 📝 Part 5. The `README.md` file

Create a simple `README.md`:

```markdown
# Box Builder Addon for FreeCAD

A simple tool to create parametric boxes with custom dimensions.

## Features
- GUI dialog for entering length, width, height
- Saves last used values between sessions
- Unique object naming
- Optional centering on origin

## Installation
1. Open FreeCAD
2. Go to **Tools → Addon Manager**
3. Search for "BoxBuilderAddon"
4. Click **Install**

Or install manually by copying the folder to your `Mod` directory.

## Requirements
- FreeCAD 0.20 or newer
```

---

## 🌐 Part 6. Publishing to GitHub

### Steps:
1. Register on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Click **New repository**
3. Name: `BoxBuilderAddon`
4. Initialize **without README** (you've already created it)
5. Click **Create repository**
6. Follow the instructions to upload your local folder:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/BoxBuilderAddon.git
git push -u origin main
```

> 💡 Replace `yourname` with your GitHub username.

---

## 🔍 Part 7. Testing the Installation

Now any user can:
1. Open FreeCAD
2. Go to **Tools → Addon Manager**
3. Click **Check for updates**
4. Find **BoxBuilderAddon** and click **Install**

> ⚠️ For the addon to appear in the **official list**, you need to submit a Pull Request to:
> 🔗 https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons

But even **without this**, users can install it via a direct link:
- In Addon Manager: **Tools → Addon Manager → ... → Install custom addon**
- Paste URL: `https://github.com/yourname/BoxBuilderAddon`

---

## 🧪 Practical Exercise

1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Prepare the full addon structure with `package.xml`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`
3. Upload the repository to GitHub
4. Install your addon via the Addon Manager on a **clean** FreeCAD copy (or delete the folder from `Mod` before installation)

---

## ✅ Summary

Now you know how to:
- Create full-fledged addons with GUI and settings
- Add icons
- Prepare metadata
- Publish to GitHub
- Make your addon available to the whole world

---

## 🎓 What's next?

You've completed the entire course! 🎉
Now you are a **FreeCAD addon developer**.

### Possible next steps:
- Add **centering** support (from Lesson 5 assignment)
- Implement **multiple input** (creating a grid of boxes)
- Integrate with **PartDesign** to create bodies of revolution
- Write an addon for **your specific task**: bolts, frames, calculations, etc.

---

## 💬 Conclusion

FreeCAD is not just a CAD program.
It's a **platform for engineering creativity**, and you now hold the key to extending it.

Write addons. Share them. Change the world — one parametric object at a time. 🛠️
