# 📘 Tutorial: Creating Addons for FreeCAD
## Lesson 1. Setting up the Development Environment

> **Lesson Goal**: Set up everything necessary to create, test, and debug addons effortlessly.

---

## 🔧 Step 1. Make sure you have FreeCAD installed

### Requirements:
- **FreeCAD version 0.20 or newer** (1.0+ is better)
- Runs on **Windows**, **Linux**, or **macOS**

👉 If you don't have FreeCAD yet, download it from the official website:
🔗 [https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php)

Choose:
- **Windows**: `.exe` (installer) or `.7z` (portable)
- **Linux**: AppImage or package from repository
- **macOS**: `.dmg`

> 💡 **Tip**: For learning, it's better to use an **installed version** (via installer), as it's more stable and easier to set up.

## 📁 Step 2. Find the Addon Folder

FreeCAD looks for user-defined addons in a special `Mod` folder.
The path depends on your OS and installation type.

### ✅ How to find the folder precisely?

1. Launch FreeCAD.
2. Open the **Python Console**:
   `View → Panels → Python console`
3. Enter the command:

```python
import FreeCAD
print(FreeCAD.getUserAppDataDir())
```

4. Press **Enter**.

You will see a path, for example:

- **Windows (installed version)**:
  `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\`
- **Windows (portable)**:
  `D:\FreeCAD\data\`
- **Linux**:
  `/home/your_name/.local/share/FreeCAD/`
- **macOS**:
  `/Users/your_name/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/`

### ➕ Create the `Mod` folder

Inside this directory, there **must be a `Mod` folder**.
If it doesn't exist, create it manually.

Example for Windows:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod\
```

> 💡 Quick way to open the folder on Windows:
> Press **Win + R** → type `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD` → Enter

## 🖥 Step 3. Configure a Text Editor (optional, but highly recommended)

While you can write code in Notepad, it's more convenient to use an editor with:
- Python syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion
- Ability to run scripts

### 🔹 We recommend: **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

1. Download and install: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the **Python** extension (from Microsoft)
3. (Optional) Install the **FreeCAD for VS Code** extension – it adds FreeCAD API hints

### 🔹 How to open the addon folder in VS Code?

1. Launch VS Code
2. `File → Open Folder`
3. Select the `Mod` folder (or a specific addon within it)

Now you can see the project structure and edit files comfortably.

## 🛠 Step 4. Explore FreeCAD's Built-in Tools

FreeCAD already contains everything you need for development.

### 1. **Python Console**
- Menu: `View → Panels → Python console`
- Allows executing commands in real-time
- Example: type `App.newDocument()` → a new document will be created

### 2. **Report View**
- Menu: `View → Panels → Report view`
- Shows **errors**, **warnings**, logs
- **Always keep it open** when testing an addon!

### 3. **Macro Recorder**
- Menu: `Macro → Macros...`
- **Record** button – records your actions as Python code
- An excellent way to **learn the FreeCAD API**

> 💡 Try this:
> 1. Click **Macro → Start recording**
> 2. Create a box (`Part → Box`)
> 3. Stop recording
> 4. Open the macro – you'll see the actual code for creating the object!

## 🧪 Step 5. Verification: Create a Test Folder

To ensure everything is working:

1. In the `Mod` folder, create a subfolder:
   ```
   TestAddon
   ```
2. Inside, create an `__init__.py` file (it can be empty) – this tells Python that the folder is a module.
3. Restart FreeCAD.
4. Open the **Report view**.

If you **don't see any errors** – it means FreeCAD successfully scanned the `Mod` folder.

> ❗ If an `ImportError` appears – check:
> - Correctness of the folder name (no spaces or Cyrillic characters)
> - Presence of `__init__.py` (not always mandatory in newer versions, but safer to add)

## 🗂 Developer Folder Structure (Summary)

By the end of this lesson, you should have this structure:

```
(FreeCAD user folder)
└── Mod/
    └── TestAddon/
        └── __init__.py   ← can be empty
```

And you know:
- Where `Mod` is located
- How to open Python Console and Report View
- How to use the Macro Recorder
- How to set up VS Code (optional)

---

## ✅ Practical Task

1. Find the `Mod` folder via `FreeCAD.getUserAppDataDir()`
2. Create a `MyFirstAddon` folder inside `Mod`
3. Add an empty `__init__.py` file to it
4. Restart FreeCAD
5. Make sure there are no errors in the **Report view**

> 🎯 **Goal**: FreeCAD should launch without errors and "see" your folder.

## ▶️ What's next?

In **Lesson 2**, we will create a **real working addon**:
- Add a button
- Make it do something
- Learn to register commands and workbenches
